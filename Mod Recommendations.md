# Mods:

## Installing Mods:

See [here](https://github.com/quaoz/minecraft-stuff/blob/main/Installing%20Mods.md) for a guide on Installing mods. 

It is generally preferred to install mods straight from GitHub (in the releases page on the right hand side) or from Modrinth instead of CurseForge as the releases available there will probably be more up to date (especially for GitHub).

---

## Optifine:

You've probably already heard of Optifine and if you haven't it's a very popular mod made to add shaders and improve performance however it causes a lot of problems and there are better alternatives especially if improving performance is what you are after.

Optifine is notorious for causing incompatibilities which are a pain for mod developers to fix as it is a closed source project. Optifine basically works by overwriting vanilla code when the game starts, this is a very invasive approach which can cause all kinds of problems when other mods try to interact with the game. For some more information about Optifine and some alternatives take a look at this gist [here](https://gist.github.com/LambdAurora/1f6a4a99af374ce500f250c6b42e8754).

## The Mod List:

These mods may not be available for the latest release so please check your using the right version if you experience problems.

### Incompatibilities:

These mods are incompatible with each other so you will have to choose **one** set, they are compatible with all of the other mods not in this section. **Basically pick either Iris, Canvas or Sodium and then add any of the mods from [this section](https://github.com/quaoz/minecraft-stuff/blob/main/Mod%20Recommendations.md#the-rest-of-the-mods).**

Iris and Canvas are both works in progress so **expect them to break.**

#### Iris and Sodium:

Iris is intended to be a replacement for Optifine which maintains compatibility with Optifine shaders. It is still a work in progress and some shaders don't yet work or only partially work. For a list of shaders that mostly work check the [What shader packs can I use right now?](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris#what-shader-packs-can-i-use-right-now) section of the readme

To use shaders you just put the shaders in the shaderpacks folder in your minecraft directory and then select them by opening video settings and clicking on the shader packs tab.

For more information about Iris check the [website](https://irisshaders.github.io/) and [readme](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris).

#### Canvas:

Canvas intended to be a replacement for Optifine which cuts all ties with it to give more control to shader developers. Like iris it its still a work in progress however it is more stable than iris. It is **not** compatible with Optifine shaders. Running canvas without a shader pack will give you better graphics and a performance boost over vanilla but i'd recommend using [LumiLights](https://github.com/spiralhalo/LumiLights) by [spiralhalo](https://github.com/spiralhalo).

[LumiLights website](https://spiralhalo.github.io/) tells you what versions of canvas you need and you put LumiLights in your resourcepacks folder once you have downloaded it. Most of the rendering settings can be found in `options > video settings > canvas` in minecraft and you will need to change the pipeline there if you want to use LumiLights.

For more information about Canvas check the readme [here](https://github.com/grondag/canvas).

#### Just sodium:

If you don't care about shaders you can just use sodium, this option will give you the best performance and takes the least effort out of the three. Sodium surpasses Optifine in terms of performance and compatibility (especially if you use Indium).

## The Rest of the Mods:

No matter what mods you use from here you will probably need the Fabric API and Cloth Config from [the APIs / Librarys section](https://github.com/quaoz/minecraft-stuff/blob/main/Mod%20Recommendations.md#apis--librarys) at the bottom. You should also use Mod Menu from [the UI section](https://github.com/quaoz/minecraft-stuff/blob/main/Mod%20Recommendations.md#ui) if you want to be able to configure most mods.
