# Resource Packs

Most of these require mods from the [graphics section](https://github.com/quaoz/minecraft-stuff/blob/main/Mod%20Recommendations.md#graphics) of my mod list, mainly connected-block-textures, chime and fabricskyboxes as well as MCPPPP from the [tools section](https://github.com/quaoz/minecraft-stuff/blob/main/Tools.md) to convert them.
