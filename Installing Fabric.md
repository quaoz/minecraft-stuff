# Installing fabric:

- Head over to [https://fabricmc.net/use/](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and download the installer (I used the `.jar` but it shouldn't matter which you use)
- Run the installer, you should be greeted with this screen:

- To keep things tidy were going to un-check `Create proflie`
- Click `install`
- You should get a screen saying the installation was successful:

- Open the minecraft launcher and click on `Installations` at the top
- First we need to open the `.minecraft` directory so hover over the row which says `Latest release` and click on the file icon on the right

- Once you click on that it will the minecraft folder, here we want to create a new folder and name it something like `Fabric 1.16.5`, now we go back to the minecraft launcher
- Click `New` in the installations tab
- Name the installation what ever you want and click on the `version` box
- Select the fabric installation, it should be called something like `release fabric-loader-0.11.3-1.16.5`
	- The first number (`0.11.3`) is the fabric installation version and the second is the minecraft version (`1.16.5`)
- In the `Game Directory` box, click browse and select the folder you created earlier
- Now click `Create`, it will take you back to the `installations` tab and there will be the new installation you created
- Click `Play` on the installation you created
- If you go back to the folder you created in the `.minecraft` directory it should now contain a bunch of folders including a `mods` folder
- You now have a fabric installation
