# Installing fabric:

- Head over to [https://fabricmc.net/use/](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and download the installer (I used the `.jar` but it shouldn't matter which you use)
- Run the installer, you should be greeted with this screen:

- Click `install`
- You should get a screen saying the installation was successful:

- Open the minecraft launcher and click on `Installations` at the top
- There should be a new installation called something like `fabric-loader-1.16.5`
- Click `Play` on the new installation
- In your minecraft folder there should now be a folder called `mods`, you can get to this folder by clicking on the folder icon for any installation in the `Installations` tab
